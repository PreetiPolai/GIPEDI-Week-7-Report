## **STORAGE OF ALL THE SENSOR DATA IN A SINGLE SQL TABLE**

<p align = "justify">As directed by Mr. Bodhibrata Mukhopadhyay, student mentor in the last week one to one interaction, I have manipulated the code to store all the sensor data - Accelerometer, Magnetometer, Gyroscope in a single table. Earlier, I stored the values recorded in the X, Y, Z coordinate and the net value of all three sensors. However, now I have restricted my data collection only to the net value of all three sensors.</p>

## **UNABLE TO CREATE A NEW TABLE FOR NEW ACTIVITIES IN ANDROID**

<p align = " justify">The Student mentor had advised me to create a new table for every new activity, such as - walking, running and others. I had searched for this but wasn't able to find something suitable. The issue being, the android framework doesn't allow creation later when the app is running. All the tables and databases need to be mentioned in the android studio in code before the android application is stored. Hence, I wasn't able to implement the feature in the existing android application. I had highlighted this point in front of the student mentor, and he further suggested using a single table and filtering all the data from them according to a different activity. </p>

## UPDATE ON THE MINT PLANT
